## myFlix-client
This is the client side of the myFlix application, which is an interface showcasing movies and their details from the movie_api database. Users can create a profile to view movies and save them as favorites. ([see movie_api repo for server side](https://github.com/mthomp35/movie_api))

The myFlix application uses full-stack JavaScript technologies - the MERN tech stack:
* MongoDD
* Express
* React
* Node.js

Heroku and Netlify were both used as hosts for this project.

Redux and Flux were used to manage the applicationâ€™s state in order to make the project more scalable in future. States managed include:
* GET_MOVIES
* FILTER_MOVIES
* GET_USER
